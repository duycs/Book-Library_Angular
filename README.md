# Home Library Client 

### If you known about the Technology, that is which I use:
- Design a Library Management System
- Backend: Domain driven design and CQRS methodology, RPC and REST API style , .Net core 2.2, MySql database, CI/CD and cloud hosting.
- Frontend is this site: Angular 7, CircleCI deploy to AWS S3 serve file hosting.

### These are todo list which I will develop in the future:
- I develop functions base on ideas like as Goodreads social and ZLibrary share ebooks online
- Fix bugs
- Update user interface, improve user experience
- Improve Backend with better authentication-authorization, server push notifications
- Sync data betwween applications: Poststudy - main social, Ludwigz - translattion
- The Library for my family and open for you with love books
